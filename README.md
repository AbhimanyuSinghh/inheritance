# inheritance
A simple Python program explaining inheritance.

One major help of OOPs is they help us follow the DRY(don't repeat yourself) principle for good code.
It means we do not have to repeat ourselves in order to keep our code as GOOD CODE.
If one property is valid for more than one class, we must make sure that we do not write the same code for all the classes,
instead, they can borrow the same method or functionality from another class and use it.
We achieve this in OOP via INHERITANCE.
Here, assume a class is created as that class is Learn, so there can be two people accessing udemy,
a CREATOR and a STUDENT. Both students and creators will have to either register or login in order to perform their tasks, 
so both of them will reuse these two methods, signIN and signUp. and they will have their own function in their respective
classes!

this is just the explanation of the inheritance topic, I have not written the codes as inheritance was the main motto,
however, I will try to write the code as well in future or you can contribute as well
